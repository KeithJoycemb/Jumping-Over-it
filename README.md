# Description
**Jumping over it is a simple puzzle platform jumping game. The player must ascend from the bottom of the level to the top traversing over gaps in the path to the top while jumping on platforms and swinging on ropes. Jumping over it is designed in a way that is meant to infuriate the player rather than hold the players hand. For example that platform that you may jump on might break and send you all the way down to the bottom to start all over again. Successfully reaching the top of the mountain the player will be able to claim the golden crown and become king of the frogs**
